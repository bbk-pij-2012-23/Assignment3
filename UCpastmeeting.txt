create past meeting

1. how about on opening iterating through the future meetings list (or maybe at the end)
2. sys: check whether date has passed
3. sys: if no, continue to next meeting
4. sys: if yes, prompt user to update records with meeting notes
5. user: yes, type notes [version 2 would allow file upload]
6. sys: addPastMeeting(contacts, date, notes). need to getContacts, getDate
7. sys: Meeting pastMeeting = new PastMeeting(params);
8. sys: remove future meeting from future meetings list;

what if date passed and they don't want to update?
I would do the same but without user input and set notes to "date passed, no confirmation that meeting occurred"

alt flow1
5. user: no.
6. sys: addPastMeeting(getID, date, "date passed, no confirmation that meeting occurred")
7. return to normal flow 7.
